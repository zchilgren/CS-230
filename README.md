Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room client wanted to expand their already existing game "Draw it or lose it" to other operating systems to expand the active player base that could participate in the game. They wanted a server based application that could be used to store the game and all of the files     needed to play the game that could then be distributed to end user based on their cuurent operating system.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  One thing I feel that I did well in the documentation was explaning the rational behind the decisions when it comes to determining how to handle the data and information regaurding the information used for user information when accessing the game and its features.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The design document made it much easier to begin work on the code. It created a clear path for creating the code and making it so I would know what needed to be able to interact with what and what feaatures needed to be created and helped to keep on that line of work as oppose to      trying to add features mid design.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the requirements that are needed for the application. I feel that everything I did have on the list needed to be there but i feel that I could have been clearer on what was needed and there are things missing from that list that would have been helplful in further       developing the program
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It is important to take the users needs into the design process is that despite the fact that the client is the one asking for the design to be created the end user is going to be the one actually using the app more than the client so taking their needs seriously is important as it    will provide the most wanted and used features.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  The technique I feel that helped the most when it came to working on this software is to take a look and read through all of the existing code that has been created for the current project. This helped with getting an understanding at what was already made and what changes needed to   be implimented to get the desiered results that were asked for by the client.
